				<p>
					Juneau is a toolkit for marshalling POJOs to a wide variety of content types using a common framework, and for creating sophisticated self-documenting REST interfaces and microservices using VERY little code. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Juneau has been in use for years on over 50 projects throughout IBM.  Recently it was hosted as a component of Jazz Foundation where it was used by several projects that make up Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management.  Many projects use only the marshalling framework, while others use the entire API to create sophisticated REST server/client interfaces. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The goals of Juneau include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Simplicity!  The ability to create complex REST interfaces in as little code as possible.  Let the developers deal with POJOs and let the framework handle the details of marshalling those POJOs.  
					<li>Discoverability!  Users should be able to navigate through and figure out how to use a REST interface through the use of auto-generated OPTIONs pages.
					<li>Customizability!  Lots of easy-to-understand configurable options throughout the framework.
					<li>Performance!  Lots of work has been done to optimize the marshalling framework for use in high-concurrency environments.  POJOs are marshalled directly without the use of intermediate DOM objects.
					<li>No code generation or code scanning.  Code generators are great until they break and nobody knows how to fix them.
					<li>No configuration or setup for using.  Simply include the library in your existing code and start using.  Packaged as either an all-in-one jar or as OSGi bundles.
					<li>Mimimal dependence on any 3rd party libraries.  See prereqs below.
					<li>Always up-to-date information by using Javadocs for documentation.  The Javadoc overview document provides an overview of the toolkit with links to detailed package-level topics.			
				</ul>

				Juneau consists of 4 components:  <b>Core</b>, <b>Server</b>, <b>Client</b>, and <b>Microservice</b>.
			</div>
			<ul class="features">
				<li><b>Core</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Simple, flexible, all-in-one API for serializing/parsing Java POJOs to JSON, XML, HTML, URL-Encoding, UON, RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N3, Turtle, N-Tuple, XML-Schema, JSON-schema, and Cognos-XML.
						<li>Serialize/parse structured documents using beans, or unstructured free-form documents using generic Maps and Collections.
						<li>DTO objects for creating ATOM feeds, Cognos, and JSON-schema in any supported languages (e.g ATOM in JSON or RDF).
						<li>Serializers have many options for tweaking output (e.g. whitespace options, XML namespace options, strict/non-strict syntax, etc...)
						<li>Sophisticated JSON parsing support.  Supports ALL valid JSON.  It also supports Javascript-style comments, single or double quoting, quoted (strict) or unquoted (non-strict) attributes, JSON fragments (e.g JSON string, numeric, boolean values), and concatenated strings.
						<li>Sophisticated API for reading and manipulating configuration INI files using POJOs. 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Server</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Build complex REST interfaces using annotations and servlets.
						<li>Automatic parsing of POJOs from HTTP bodies, form posts, query parameters, URL variables, request attributes, headers, etc...
						<li>Automatic serializing of POJOs to HTTP responses.
						<li>Automatic error handling.
						<li>Automatic self-documenting OPTIONs pages.
						<li>Support for guards, filters, etc...
						<li>Simple internationalization support.
						<li>JAX-RS integration support.
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Client</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Simple REST Client API for interacting with REST services using POJOs.  Built on top of Apache HTTP Client.
						<li>Ability to retrieve POJO proxies that use REST as the communications protocol.
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Microservice</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Build self-contained REST interfaces as executable jars.
						<li>Built on top of embedded Jetty and configured through either external INI config files or manifest files.
						<li>A single compact library of less than 1MB.
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			Apache Juneau is an effort undergoing

			manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
			incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
			or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet
